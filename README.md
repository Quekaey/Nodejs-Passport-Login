# Nodejs-Passport-Login

User authentication and login is the most important feature of many websites, 
I used Express for the server backend and Passport to help manage the logged in state of users. 
I properly encrypt and hash all user passwords so that the application is completely secure. 

Steps 
- Setting up a server with Node.js and Express
- Setting up Passport with Node.js and Express
- encrypt user passwords
- Restricting access to routes to only logged in users
- Showing flash messages with Node.js and Express
